The install for this is available for windows and linux in the release section.

### windows release
(download available in the release section)
download, install and execute just easy as that. The sharkle will not be clickable on the transparent parts :( -anyone who can help with that will be appreciated- 

### linux
(download available in the release section)
Download the sharkle.appImage and place it somewhere safe. Then open it doing `./sharkle.appImage` after that it should just open. If you enable auto-launch you shouldn't move the appImage file from place. 
The sharkle will appear in the tasks list (the one from alt + tab) -anyone who want to help with that also appreciated-
